I played Waltz for Debby by Bill Evans at my PhD graduation day. It was messy but I can't forget this moment.

Someday my prince will come by Hank Jones was actually the my first motivation to start to learn jazz piano. His play was exceptionally sweet and beautiful for me. I couldn't find any music sheets of this play as most of jazz plays do.
