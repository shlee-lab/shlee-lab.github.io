I'm a PhD researcher focused on `Blockchain` and `Cybersecurity`. Before academia, I spent 7 years in the military and finished as an <a href="/blog/2023/militray-duty/">army captain</a>, which gave me some disciplined and hands-on experience. Now, Iâ€™m working on blockchain security at <a href="https://www.tokamak.network/about">Tokamak Network</a>, dealing with Layer 2 scalability and security issues. I also travel the world (mostly in Europe), and that really adds some fresh perspectives to my life. Outside of tech, I enjoy conversations about <a href="https://suhyeonlee.xyz/blog/2024/trip-in-Prague/">history</a>, philosophy, jazz and science.


Current projects working on:
<ul>
    <li> Layer 2 security and cost analysis (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04111'>recent article</a>)</li>
    <li> On-chain distributed random beacon (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06498'>recent article</a>) </li>
