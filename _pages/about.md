I'm a PhD researcher specializing in `Blockchain` and `Cybersecurity`, with a background in the military where I served for 7 years (final rank <a href="/blog/2023/militray-duty/">army captain</a>). It brings me a unique blend of academic rigor and practical experience to the field. I'm now working on security for blockchain technologies at <a href="https://www.tokamak.network/about">Tokamak Network</a>, focusing on solving Layer 2 scalability issues. As a nomad, I travel the world, which enriches my work and broadens my perspectives. I love discussing history, philosophy, as well as computer science.



Current projects working on:
<ul>
    <li> On-chain distributed random beacon (Related <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06498'>Preprint</a>) </li>
    <li> Layer 2 security analysis on withdrawal</li>
</ul>
