As a PhD researcher specializing in `Cybersecurity` and `Blockchain`, I had honorably finished military duty as an Army Captain. I am currently working as a security researcher at Tokamak Network. I have developed a wealth of knowledge and experience in these fields. With earlier experience at the ROK Cyber Operations Command, and the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), my expertise is in cybersecurity practice, and my research emphasis is on consensus mechanisms in blockchain. I am enthusiastic about contributing to the advancement of these fields and collaborating with others to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems.
