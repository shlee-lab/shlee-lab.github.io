Who could imagine a war waged to force a country to accept drug imports? At that time, the Qing Empire was far from a pushover, with substantial military resources including numerous soldiers, cannons, and sailing ships. Thus, the early stages of the war were not as straightforward for the British, who had initially sent only a small force. A pivotal moment came with the arrival of a single ship, which alone could be said to have decided the shocking outcome of the war. This warship, the Nemesis, was an ironclad steamship, a marvel of the latest technological advancements of its era. <br/><br/> Firstly, the Nemesis, as a steamship, facilitated navigation independent of wind—a capability beyond any traditional sailing ship. Secondly, its ironclad design rendered it impervious to the Qing's outdated cannons, which could neither breach its armor nor set it aflame. Thirdly, a shocking tactical advantage was its ability to navigate up the Qing's canals—a feat made possible by its lightweight iron construction. While wooden ships required thick, heavy planking, iron ships could be built with thinner, stronger hulls that did not sink too deeply into the water. This allowed the Nemesis to access and dominate canals that were too shallow for other warships, taking control over a critical transport route for the Qing imperial treasury. Ultimately, this led the Qing dynasty which was already under a unfavorable situation to surrender and sign the Treaty of Nanking, ceding Hong Kong. </div> <div id="korean" class="content korean"> 영국에는 수많은 불명예스러운 역사가 있지만 청나라를 상대로한 아편 전쟁은 그 중에서도 손에 꼽은 믿을 수 없는 이유로 벌어진 전쟁이다. 상대국에 마약 수입을 강제하기 위한 전쟁을 그 누가 상상할 수 있을까? 당시 청나라는 쇄락했을지언정 단연코 만만한 국가는 아니었다. 군사는 많았고 포도 많았고 범선도 많이 갖추고 있었다. 그렇기에 전쟁 초창기는 소수의 병력을 파견했던 영국 입장에서 쉽게 흘러가지만은 않고 있었다. 그러던 중 등장한 단 한 척의 배가 전쟁의 충격적인 결과를 결정했다고 해도 무리가 아니다. 그 전함의 이름은 네메시스로서 철선이자 증기선으로서 당시 최신 과학기술의 집합체였다. <br/><br/> 먼저, 네메시스함은 증기선으로서 기존에 범선이 할 수 없는 바람과 무관한 항해를 증기기관으로 용이하게 만들었다. 두번째로 이는 철선이었기 때문에 청나라의 구식포가 이 철갑을 감히 파괴할 수 없었고 불이 붙지도 않았다. 세번째로 충격적인 점은 네메시스가 청의 운하를 타고 올라가 장악했다는 점인데 이 역시 철선이라는 점에 기인한다. 같은 규모의 배에서 철선은 목선보다 매우 가볍다. 목재는 두껍게 덧대야 하는 반면, 철은 얇게 펴서 튼튼하게 받쳐줄 수 있다. 그렇기 때문에 배의 바닥이 물 속으로 깊게 가라앉지 않게 제작할 수 있다. 네메시스함은 기존의 전함들으로는 불가능했던 수심이 상대적으로 얕은 운하를 거슬러 올라가 장악하였다. 이 한 척의 배에게 장악당한 운하는 청나라 황실 재정에 핵심적인 수송로였기 때문에 수세에도 버티던 청나라 황실은 굴복하여 홍콩을 할양하는 난징조약을 체결하게 된다. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/Avante-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/Avante-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/Avante-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Avante-3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> The 2024 Hyundai Avante, as known as Elantra, arrvied with a beautiful package </div> <div id="english" class="content english active"> The Nemesis was powered by two steam engines, each producing 60 horsepower, for a total of 120 horsepower—slightly less than the 130 horsepower of the Hyundai Elantra (Avante in Korea) I've just bought. <br/><br/> However, this Avante is not mine.

Wenceslas Square in 1968 and 2024. </div> Traveling to Prague in the spring naturally brings to mind the Prague Spring of 1968, a bold attempt to resist communism. (Photo 1 shows Wenceslas Square with our accommodation visible in one of the buildings to the right of the photo. Photo 2 is a nighttime view of Wenceslas Square from the opposite side.) Spring offers pleasant weather for exploring. Prague, located at the western edge of the Iron Curtain, is the capital of the Czech Republic. However, upon reaching the heart of Prague, the Eastern Bloc atmosphere fades, and one can instantly feel that it was once the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and a central hub of European politics. The most beautiful views in Prague include Charles Bridge and Prague Castle (especially St. Vitus Cathedral, as seen in photos 3 and 4). Charles Bridge, built during the reign of Charles IV, connects Prague Castle to the Old Town and has been a crucial link throughout Prague's golden age. The vast area of Prague Castle and its numerous Gothic and Baroque buildings showcase the city's prosperous past. Even at the center of the empire, traces of the Eastern Bloc are evident. Photo 5 features a building at Prague Castle (formerly a Habsburg imperial educational site for children) with an "Easter egg" bas-relief from the communist era. <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Prague-3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-4-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-4-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-4-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Prague-4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photo 3 and 4. St. Vitus Cathedral. </div> Moreover, Prague Castle is famous not only for its stunning scenery but also as the starting point for two international wars, both bizarrely initiated by defenestrations. Therefore, when in conflict with Czechs, one must avoid oppressive tactics, especially near windows. The first of these wars, the less-known Hussite Wars (1419-1434), was sparked by the martyrdom of the reformer Jan Hus and involved several battles between the Catholic forces of the Pope and the locals in Prague. The second is the well-known Thirty Years' War. Photo 6 shows the building from which Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II's representatives and messengers were thrown by Bohemian nobles. Despite the height suggesting a lethal intent, surprisingly, all survived. This act against the emperor's Catholic delegation led to a brutal thirty-year conflict dividing principalities into Catholic and Protestant camps, with major European powers like France, Denmark, and Sweden intervening without gaining clear benefits. The Holy Roman Empire's population was reduced by a third, and the emperor's power weakened further. Reflecting on this period of decline, it seems that managing an empire without a pragmatic approach to tolerance is challenging. Despite its federal characteristics, the Holy Roman Empire gradually ceased to be holy, Roman, or an empire. <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-5-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-5-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-5-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Prague-5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-6-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-6-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-6-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Prague-6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> (left) Photo 5.

(사진1, 바츨라프 광장 사진으로 숙소도 이 사진 우측에 보이는 건물 중 하나에 위치하였다. 사진 2. 반대편에서 찍은 바츨라프 광장의 야경 ) 봄이기에 여행하기에 날씨가 좋은 것은 물론이다. 프라하는 동구권 철의 장막 서쪽 끝자락에 위치한 체코의 수도였다. 하지만 프라하의 중심에 이르면, 동구권의 분위기는 느낄 수 없고 체코가 신성로마제국의 수도였고, 유럽 정치의 중심에 위치했던 곳이라는 것을 단번에 느낄 수 있다. 프라하에서 가장 아름다운 풍경은 까를교와 함께 프라하성(특히, 성 비투스 대성당, - 사진 3, 4)을 바라보는 것이다. 까를교는 프라하의 전성기를 이룩한 까를 4세 때 지어져 프라하성과 구시가지를 잇는 가장 중요한 다리로서 역할을 해왔다. 면적상으로 최대 크기의 프라하 성과 수많은 고딕양식과 바로크양식의 건축물들은 프라하가 언제 얼마나 번성하였는지 보여준다. 제국의 중심에도 동구권의 흔적은 있다. 사진 5에 공산정권 당시 프라하 궁에 있는 건물(과거 합스부르크 황실의 아이들을 위한 교육 장소) 부조에 이스터에그를 숨겨놓았다. <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Prague-3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-4-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-4-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/Prague-4-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Prague-4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photo 3 and 4.

The first is Agency for Defense Development (ADD), which is the primary research center of Korean defense research, and the second is the Cyber Operations Command. ADD is a research institute that researches a wide variety of weapons systems. Conventional weapons such as rifles, tanks, and missiles, the headquarters where I worked was a place to research cyber weapons systems.</p> <p>First of all, I was able to meet many precious relationships at ADD. There was not much I could do because it was too much to work at the research institute after just graduating from the undergraduate school. Yet, I was able to grow a lot there as a researcher. There were two main factors, the first was because I met good senior researchers who led me to help with research in various ways. I still have good relations with the researchers. The second was my will to research and the admission of a graduate Ph.D. program. I wasn’t allowed to go to graduate school in the first year because my military administrator did not allow me to because there was no case that the second lieutenant enters a graduate school in the history of Korean military (indeed, this was an improper order), but from the second year as the first lieutenant, I started research at the School of Cybersecurity at Korea University after work everyday. By the time I finished my career at ADD, I had grown to the level of a master’s degree. For example, I presented my own research at the INFOCOM workshop in 2019.</p> <p>After completing my service at ADD, I started a new job as captain until the point of completing 7 years of duty at the Cyber Operations Command through allocation according to application. At that time, the Cyber Operations Command still looked cluttered after the comment unit scandal. It is difficult to reveal my specific affiliation, but I mostly carried out R&amp;D work except for some other participation. The R&amp;D work here was very different from that at ADD. Rather than looking far away, the major task was to develop and distribute technologies that could be used immediately in the operation. However, the biggest problem was that there was no people capable of R&amp;D. In order to carry out R&amp;D, personnel with R&amp;D experience and senior researchers capable of leading research projects are required (I believe). It is difficult to describe in detail, but all were absent. This is not to criticize the level of people there, but I would like to criticize the person who designed this structure of organizations. Most of the military guys do not exist to carry out R&amp;D, and R&amp;D is fundamentally impossible with manpower allocated through circular work. If R&amp;D is possible through an order, I would like to ask why the graduate school system exists.</p> <p>Be that as it may, I finished my military service with a smile like the picture below.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/mil-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/mil-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/mil-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/mil-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Picture taken right before discharge. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="essay"/><category term="military"/><category term="experience"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[what I could see and feel in the Korean military as an officer]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kor) Random Number on Blockchain using VDF — 3.</title><link href="https://shlee-lab.github.io/blog/2023/kor-random-number-on-blockchain-using-vdf3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kor) Random Number on Blockchain using VDF — 3."/><published>2023-11-08T15:17:58+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-08T15:17:58+00:00</updated><id>https://shlee-lab.github.io/blog/2023/kor-random-number-on-blockchain-using-vdf3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://shlee-lab.github.io/blog/2023/kor-random-number-on-blockchain-using-vdf3/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Random Number on Blockchain using VDF — 3.

It is an old town with a beautiful medieval appearance. However, Old Town is not the place where the Estonians lived.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/tallinn-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Tallinn's old town entrance. </div> <p>According to the locals, this is where the Germans lived, who owned the Estonians who were serfs. Estonians are said to have lived outside the walls in very shabby places like thatched houses. Old Town has a medieval atmosphere and is well-managed, so I took a look around and left for where the Estonians lived.</p> <p>See the below two photos. The place I visited where the Estonians lived is a residential complex built during the Soviet era. Estonia was communist and annexed by the Soviet Union, and it had an independent history in 1991. In this place, you could see three to five stories of apartments that looked like matchboxes. Most of the exterior is not properly maintained. I could see paint peeling everywhere. It is said that what is more serious than the appearance is the inside. There were also buildings with high floors or slightly colorful exterior decorations, which are said to have been built during the Stalin era. It is said that it was built to look splendid to show the excellence of communism, but only the outside looks good and the inside is seriously bad.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/tallinn-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/tallinn-3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Apartments built in the Soviet era. </div> <p>In particular, buildings built after the mid-Soviet era were often stolen by people during construction. So, especially those who are “allocated” on the upper floor of the apartment building are completely ruined, but there are no pipes that pull water up, or there are several serious missing building interior materials. As usual, there probably wasn’t a problem on paper.</p> <p>On the other hand, in the communist system, it was a concept of renting from the state, not owning real estate, so it was a concept of applying for an apartment and renting it in the Soviet era. With Estonia’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the places where the inhabitants lived were said to have been converted to their own. However, existing residents who owned real estate at the time of communism were treated as bourgeoisie or rich farmers and were taken to Siberia or executed, and their real estate was converted to state ownership, so such assets became an issue. It is said that some work was carried out to return the real estate that was unfairly taken by their descendants. However, it is said that only part of the record is made because it is not easy to find and prove the long-standing record of the country that has now disappeared on paper. The situation is very different, but it reminds me of Korea’s return of pro-Japanese property rights.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="trip"/><category term="history"/><category term="culture"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the modern Estonian city Tallinn, I looked around the old medieval city, and the Stalin-style village.]]></summary></entry></feed>
