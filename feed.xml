It is an old town with a beautiful medieval appearance. However, Old Town is not the place where the Estonians lived.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/tallinn-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Tallinn's old town entrance. </div> <p>According to the locals, this is where the Germans lived, who owned the Estonians who were serfs. Estonians are said to have lived outside the walls in very shabby places like thatched houses. Old Town has a medieval atmosphere and is well-managed, so I took a look around and left for where the Estonians lived.</p> <p>See the below two photos. The place I visited where the Estonians lived is a residential complex built during the Soviet era. Estonia was communist and annexed by the Soviet Union, and it had an independent history in 1991. In this place, you could see three to five stories of apartments that looked like matchboxes. Most of the exterior is not properly maintained. I could see paint peeling everywhere. It is said that what is more serious than the appearance is the inside. There were also buildings with high floors or slightly colorful exterior decorations, which are said to have been built during the Stalin era. It is said that it was built to look splendid to show the excellence of communism, but only the outside looks good and the inside is seriously bad.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/tallinn-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/tallinn-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/tallinn-3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Apartments built in the Soviet era. </div> <p>In particular, buildings built after the mid-Soviet era were often stolen by people during construction. So, especially those who are “allocated” on the upper floor of the apartment building are completely ruined, but there are no pipes that pull water up, or there are several serious missing building interior materials. As usual, there probably wasn’t a problem on paper.</p> <p>On the other hand, in the communist system, it was a concept of renting from the state, not owning real estate, so it was a concept of applying for an apartment and renting it in the Soviet era. With Estonia’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the places where the inhabitants lived were said to have been converted to their own. However, existing residents who owned real estate at the time of communism were treated as bourgeoisie or rich farmers and were taken to Siberia or executed, and their real estate was converted to state ownership, so such assets became an issue. It is said that some work was carried out to return the real estate that was unfairly taken by their descendants. However, it is said that only part of the record is made because it is not easy to find and prove the long-standing record of the country that has now disappeared on paper. The situation is very different, but it reminds me of Korea’s return of pro-Japanese property rights.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="trip"/><category term="history"/><category term="culture"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the modern Estonian city Tallinn, I looked around the old medieval city, and the Stalin-style village.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Trip in Warsaw, Uprising despite of tragic history</title><link href="https://shlee-lab.github.io/blog/2023/trip-in-Warsaw/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trip in Warsaw, Uprising despite of tragic history"/><published>2023-06-12T19:53:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-06-12T19:53:00+00:00</updated><id>https://shlee-lab.github.io/blog/2023/trip-in-Warsaw</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://shlee-lab.github.io/blog/2023/trip-in-Warsaw/"><![CDATA[<p>What is the representative architecture of Warsaw, Poland. The Old Town of Warsaw does not look like something really old. It’s an old design, but it won’t give you an old feeling. Warsaw is a city directly destroyed by World War II, probably because most of its buildings have been collapsed and rebuilt.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/warsaw-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/warsaw-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/warsaw-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/warsaw-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Pałac Kulturyi Nauki (PKiN) at night with the red light. </div> <p>Figure 1. One of the representative buildings that comes to mind when you think of Warsaw, the Pałac Kulturyi Nauki (PKiN), is a tragic building that makes Polish people feel complicated. It is said that the building was built as a gift by Stalin, who forcibly communized Poland after World War II. In fact, it is so large (237m) that it is said that a building taller than this building was built in Warsaw only recently. This Stalin-style building can also be seen in Moscow, and its design gives people a sense of supression, not just its size.</p> <p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Poland immediately abandoned the communist system. Considering the humiliating things that the Soviet Union did to Poland, it may be deserved to blow it up like the Japanese Government-General of Korea, but as I mentioned before, it is too large a building. It’s such a big building that I can see well, so whenever I saw this building while walking around the streets of Warsaw, I thought about the Polish history.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/warsaw-2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/warsaw-2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/warsaw-2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/warsaw-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Józef Poniatowski statue in front of the presidential palace. </div> <p>Figure 2. Poland had a glorious era during a Polish-Lithuanian Grand Duchy. After the kingdom’s collapse, it has actually only gone downhill. Even if the results were not good, there should be respect for the bravery of the Poles in the process. There were statues of various historical figures around Warsaw Old Town, but I felt that Józef Poniatowski in front of the presidential palace was a good representation of Polish history. Many nobles were irresponsible of the crisis in their motherland, but many Poles fought bravely against the crisis in their mother country. Poniatowski stepped up and fought valiantly at every crisis in his country. He also served in the French army to regain his country and rose to one of the 26 French Marshal of Napoleon. It is said that he died in the final rush in the battlefield, which became disadvantageous even though he was brave and competent. And the situation in Poland continued to be bad, as Napoleon, who was favorable to Poland, fell.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/warsaw-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/warsaw-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/warsaw-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/warsaw-3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Sign of Warsaw citizens during the uprising. </div> <p>Figure 3.

Keeping in mind the response of the Soviet Red Army, which finally arrived in front of Warsaw in the late World War II, the Warsaw people uprised bravely against the occupied Nazi army, many of which were unarmed, but failed with numerous casualties. But the Poles built an uprising museum to remember their courage and spirit.

The first is Agency for Defense Development (ADD), which is the primary research center of Korean defense research, and the second is the Cyber Operations Command. ADD is a research institute that researches a wide variety of weapons systems. Conventional weapons such as rifles, tanks, and missiles, the headquarters where I worked was a place to research cyber weapons systems.</p> <p>First of all, I was able to meet many precious relationships at ADD. There was not much I could do because it was too much to work at the research institute after just graduating from the undergraduate school. Yet, I was able to grow a lot there as a researcher. There were two main factors, the first was because I met good senior researchers who led me to help with research in various ways. I still have good relations with the researchers. The second was my will to research and the admission of a graduate Ph.D. program. I wasn’t allowed to go to graduate school in the first year because my military administrator did not allow me to because there was no case that the second lieutenant enters a graduate school in the history of Korean military (indeed, this was an improper order), but from the second year as the first lieutenant, I started research at the School of Cybersecurity at Korea University after work everyday. By the time I finished my career at ADD, I had grown to the level of a master’s degree. For example, I presented my own research at the INFOCOM workshop in 2019.</p> <p>After completing my service at ADD, I started a new job as captain until the point of completing 7 years of duty at the Cyber Operations Command through allocation according to application. At that time, the Cyber Operations Command still looked cluttered after the comment unit scandal. It is difficult to reveal my specific affiliation, but I mostly carried out R&amp;D work except for some other participation. The R&amp;D work here was very different from that at ADD. Rather than looking far away, the major task was to develop and distribute technologies that could be used immediately in the operation. However, the biggest problem was that there was no people capable of R&amp;D. In order to carry out R&amp;D, personnel with R&amp;D experience and senior researchers capable of leading research projects are required (I believe). It is difficult to describe in detail, but all were absent. This is not to criticize the level of people there, but I would like to criticize the person who designed this structure of organizations. Most of the military guys do not exist to carry out R&amp;D, and R&amp;D is fundamentally impossible with manpower allocated through circular work. If R&amp;D is possible through an order, I would like to ask why the graduate school system exists.</p> <p>Be that as it may, I finished my military service with a smile like the picture below.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/mil-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/mil-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/mil-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/mil-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Picture taken right before discharge. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="essay"/><category term="military"/><category term="experience"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[what I could see and feel in the Korean military as an officer]]></summary></entry></feed>
